# osticket-ticketwidget

![](https://github.com/sjsanc/osticket-ticketwidget/blob/master/ticket.JPG) 

A userscript that allows users to easily create an overview of their ticket queues defined in osTicket. 

Only tested on firefox using Violentmonkey but it should be fine on any browser. 

To install, click [this](https://github.com/sjsanc/osticket-ticketwidget/raw/master/ticketwidget.user.js) link. It should open up your userscript manager and prompt you to complete the installation. If it doesn't, you can download the .js file and add it manually. 

If you find any bugs please let me know.
